# A little insight into Carlos Rodrigo
Hi, Everyone! My name is Carlos Rodrigo and I am reading the book Github for Dummies. This README will give you a bit of information about me!

## My Career Passions
I really love working in tech. Specifically, I love Deep Learning and Neural Networks, and the language: Python.

## My Hobbies
One of my favorite things to do is go to the Mountains - walk around and see the magnificent landscape and feeling the magic is enough for me :smile:
